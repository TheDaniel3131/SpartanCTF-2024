This challenge is quite annoying to deal with but after all these mess I realized I am just
dumb. It is suprisingly easy than you think!


This challenge hints Caesar Cipher & Rail Fence.


Obviously this string right here:

k_1h3S40s309}jS25l{S1sXJ0fLV6U!


It is not a proper flag. 


So we have to do Rail Fence first.


Notice the challenge also states about Eight. It could be meant Rail Key is equal to 8.

I use this website to crack out the rail fence text:

https://crypto.interactive-maths.com/rail-fence-cipher.html


I added my own custom list (just to cover every possible symbols and letters could be): abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789!@#$%^&*()_Â±=[]{}|;':",.<>/?



as the result: khsjlsfulx{s33_s02sjv!60159410}


And the rest is caesar cipher-ing.


all my processes are stored in imgur, please do check them out.
